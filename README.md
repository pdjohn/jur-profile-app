# Profile App
A JUR backend assignment for the developers.

## Question and the answers of this assignment

### What was your approach to this project? Did it change as you developed the app further?
At first I read the assignment. After that I began to focus on the Database design. I tried to keep a close eye to the performance and execution time. 
I first planned what to do so the app did not change much. But of course I would like to change this to make a better version of it.



### What were the challenges you faced?
As I go deeper in this app I came t realize that the organization and experience of a person will be multiple entry but there is not anything written in the assignment. In that, I was a bit puzzled to go for multiple or to focus on single data.

### How differently will you do if you had a couple of more days to complete the assignment? What if you have one full month?
If a had a couple more days, first I'll concentrated on the test cases. I'll try to cover all the parts in the test cases so that I'll know if I have to make any update in the codebase then how will it behave. I'll be sure that, will it be broken or working properly.
About the full month, I'll go for reviewing the assignment and focus on the multiple entry of the experience. After that, I will work on the organization. The information containing about the organization in the assignment will not update much. So I would like to save it in a table and let others use it by searching. If a entry is not match in out database, we will store that information.
